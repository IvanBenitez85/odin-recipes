    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Combine cassava flour, salt, cayenne, butter, and Cheddar cheese in a large bowl by rubbing the mixture between
        your fingertips until it resembles large, coarse crumbs. Drizzle in milk and continue mixing and rubbing with
        your hands until the mixture resembles very small pebbles and is moist enough to hold together in large clumps
        when squeezed tightly together; add more milk if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place a small (6-inch) dry, nonstick pan over medium-high heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Transfer in a heaping
        1/2 cup cassava mixture or enough to cover the bottom of the pan. The mixture should be 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch
        deep. Press the top of the mixture down slightly to settle and use a spatula to go around the edges of the
        mixture, pressing any loose crumbs back into the flatbread.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cover and cook until the bottom is golden brown, a crust forms under the flatbread, and a spatula can be slid
        underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over with a combination of tossing the pan up slightly while flipping with the
        spatula. You can also place a plate over the pan, then invert the flatbread and slide it back into the pan. Cook
        the other side until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from heat and let rest for 2 minutes before
        serving warm.
    </p>
